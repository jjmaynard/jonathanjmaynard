      <description>Jonathan Maynard is a Research Ecologist at the USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range. His research employs a basic and applied approach to pedology that centers on anthropogenic impacts and quantifies and predicts patterns and processes of human-affected soil change. His current research focuses on large scale spatial modeling of soil and ecological properties, leveraging national-to-global datasets, remote sensing and machine learning to characterize natural resources and better inform land management.</description>
