  abstract = {The assessment and monitoring of soil disturbance and its effect on soil
quality (i.e., ability to support a range of ecosystem services) has
been hindered due to the shortcomings of many traditional analytical
techniques, including high cost, long-term time investment and
difficulties with data interpretation. Consequently, there is a critical
need to develop rapid and repeatable approaches for quantifying changes
in soil quality that land managers may use to assess the condition and
trend of natural and managed ecosystems. Here we report on a rapid, high
throughput approach using fingerprint Fourier transformed infrared
(FTIR) spectroscopy and chemometric modeling. Fingerprint FTIR
incorporates all information embedded within the FTIR spectrum, thus
producing a biogeochemical or ecological ``fingerprint{\{}''{\}} of the soil.
This methodology was applied in a highly disturbed forest ecosystem over
a 19-year sampling period to detect, via spectral analysis, changes in
dynamic soil properties (e.g., soil organic matter and reactive
mineralogy) that can indicate changes in soil quality. Two chemometric
statistical techniques (i.e., hierarchical clustering analysis {\{}[{\}}HCA]
and discriminate analysis of principal components {\{}[{\}}DAPC]) were
evaluated for interpreting and quantifying similarities/dissimilarities
between samples utilizing the entire FTIR spectra from each sample. We
found that both statistical approaches provided a means for clearly
discriminating between degraded soils, soils in recovery, and reference
soils. DAPC analysis provided additional information on the spectral
wavenumbers most important in differentiating between soil samples
across our disturbance time series. Wavenumbers relating to stretching
of phenolic (C-O), aromatic (C=C, C-C), carboxylic acids (C=O), and to a
lesser extent aliphatic (C-H) bonds were important in discriminating
between soil samples. These results confirmed our visual interpretation
of FTIR spectra, where an increase in aliphatic (fats and lipids) and
decrease in phenolic/aromatic (lignin) absorption occurred following
intensive site disturbance, followed by a return to predisturbance
absorption values 17 years later. Results from this study illustrate the
potential of fingerprint FTIR and chemometrics as an efficient technique
for quantifying changes in soil quality that may be used in the
monitoring and assessment of soil landscape change. Additional research
across a range of soil ecosystems and under different types of ecosystem
disturbance is needed to further validate this approach and to
demonstrate its wide applicability as a land management tool.},
