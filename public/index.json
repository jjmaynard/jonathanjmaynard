Landscape metrics developed from LiDAR and remote sensing are important inputs into these models. In my research, I have been exploring how recent advances in remotely sensed spatial data (e.g., LiDAR, Hyper-Spatial/Spectral imagery) and computation capacity (e.g., Google Earth Engine), may improve our ability to scale-up our observations/predictions of soil properties and processes from the pedon-scale to the landscape-scale.\nMy research has examined the scale-dependency of LiDAR-derived terrain attributes in digital soil mapping. Results from this work have shown that in high relief forested ecosystems (Fig. 1c), high resolution LiDAR data (i.e., less than 5m) is too fine to approximate soil-landscape processes and that coarser scale DEM derived terrain attributes produce optimal correlations in soil-landscape models. An explicit understanding of the scale dependency of soil and related environmental attributes is thus essential in our ability to quantify how land-use and climate change may impact natural and managed lands across vast spatial extents.\nQuantifying the spatial distribution of soil properties is essential for ecological and environmental modeling at the landscape scale, as well as for promoting sustainable resource management. Since approximately 60% of all U.S. forests are actively managed for timber production and forests represent the largest terrestrial C sink, understanding how forest management practices (i.e., fertilization, clear-cutting, prescribed burns) influence soil carbon cycling and storage is critical. My research is also examining the use of chemometric modeling using mid-infrared spectroscopy as an inexpensive, high-throughput method for predicting soil properties. When implemented in a spatially-explicit way, chemometric modeling may be integrated with soil-landscape modeling techniques, allowing for accurate prediction of soil properties and classes across landscapes.\nThe frequency and severity of drought is expected to increase in the 21st century as a result of climate change. Understanding the timing, duration and spatial extent of prolonged periods of drought is important in managing and sustaining the ecological structure and function of managed ecosystems. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages approximately 70 million ha of public lands within the continental U.S. BLM lands are managed for multiple uses (e.g., livestock grazing, recreation, timber harvesting), with each land-use having different potential ecological impacts in responses to drought. Additionally, the severity of drought across a landscape varies in response to landscape heterogeneity, thus creating even greater spatial and temporal variability in how individual land-uses may impact ecosystem function. Consequently, there is a critical need to develop a spatially-explicit drought monitoring framework that provides near real-time information at spatial scales relevant to land management decisions. My research has developed a modeling framework that uses freely available MODIS satellite imagery to calculate the drought severity index (DSI) at a 1 km spatial resolution and 16-day temporal resolution across 70 million ha of BLM managed lands between the years 2000 and 2014. This DSI time series was analyzed using a near real-time disturbance monitoring approach based on a Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST) model. The BFAST-type season-trend model automatically identified and modeled stable historical variation within each pixel time series from 2000 to 2009. Newly acquired data (2009-present) was then evaluated relative to this stable baseline, with significant positive (wetter) or negative (drier) deviations identified. Results from several drought-prone areas were evaluated using field-based soil moisture data. This approach quantified both the magnitude and date of significant change, providing land managers with spatially explicit near real-time information on drought condition that can help direct management actions to minimize land-use impacts.\n","date":1580454000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580454000,"objectID":"ec82c3f7dd00a02cdacd9a9da18a42a8","permalink":"/project/digital-soil-mapping/","publishdate":"2020-01-31T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/digital-soil-mapping/","section":"project","summary":"Emerging techniques and advances in soil landscape modeling","tags":["Digitat Soil Mapping","Soil Landscape Modeling"],"title":"Digital Soil Mapping","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Environmental monitoring and soil ecosystem restoration Unprecedented rates of ecosystem change have occured as a result of human activities, with 43% of the Earth's land surface experiencing some form of human induced degradation.

Given the magnitude of the soil C pool, it is critical to understand the effects of forest management practices and projected climate change on soil C dynamics. Additionally, these effects will likely influence other important nutrient cycles (e.g., N, P, K), thus potentially impacting forest growth and productivity.\nMy research has examined the biogeochemical cycling of C and metals in forest ecosystem, which are largely considered aerobic environments. Growing evidence, however, suggests that forest soils may contain a high proportion of suboxic/anoxic microsites (~50% of Douglas Fir Oa horizon; Van der Lee et. al., 1999) and that ~50% of all organic matter decomposition may occur anaerobically (Schink, 2006).

Digital mapping provides an approach for optimizing the spatial scale of modeling products to best serve decision makers and have the greatest impact in addressing land management concerns. Here, we present a spatial modeling framework for mapping ecological sites using machine learning algorithms, soil survey field observations, soil survey geographic databases, ecological site data, and a suite of remote sensing-based spatial covariates (e.g., hyper-temporal remote sensing, terrain attributes, climate data, land-cover, lithology). Based on the theoretical association between ecological sites and landscape biophysical properties, we hypothesized that the spatial distribution of ecological sites could be predicted using readily available geospatial data. This modeling approach was tested at two study areas within the western United States, representing 6.1 million ha on the Colorado Plateau and 7.5 million ha within the Chihuahuan Desert.

A common phenomenon observed in natural and constructed wetlands is short-circuiting of flow and formation of stagnant zones that are only indirectly connected with the incoming water. Biogeochemistry of passive areas is potentially much different than that of active zones. In the research reported in this paper, the spatial resolution of a previously developed wetland nutrient cycling model was improved in order to capture the spatial variability of concentrations and reaction rates regarding nitrogen and carbon cycles throughout active and passive zones of wetlands. The upgraded model allows for several compartments in the horizontal domain, with all neighboring compartments connected through advective and dispersive/diffusive mass transport. The model was applied to data collected from a restored wetland in California that was characterized by the formation of a large stagnant zone at the southern end of the wetland due to close vicinity of the inlet and outlet structures in the northern end. Mass balance analysis revealed that over the course of the research period, about 23.4±3.9\\% of the incoming total nitrogen load was removed or retained by the wetland. It was observed that mass of all exchanges (physical and biogeochemical) regarding nitrogen cycling decreased along the activity gradient from active to passive zones.

A common phenomenon observed in natural and constructed wetlands is short-circuiting of flow and formation of stagnant zones that are only indirectly connected with the incoming water. Biogeochemistry of passive areas is potentially much different than that of active zones. In the research reported in this paper, the spatial resolution of a previously developed wetland nutrient cycling model was improved in order to capture the spatial variability of concentrations and reaction rates regarding nitrogen and carbon cycles throughout active and passive zones of wetlands. The upgraded model allows for several compartments in the horizontal domain, with all neighboring compartments connected through advective and dispersive/diffusive mass transport. The model was applied to data collected from a restored wetland in California that was characterized by the formation of a large stagnant zone at the southern end of the wetland due to close vicinity of the inlet and outlet structures in the northern end. Mass balance analysis revealed that over the course of the research period, about 23.4±3.9\\% of the incoming total nitrogen load was removed or retained by the wetland. It was observed that mass of all exchanges (physical and biogeochemical) regarding nitrogen cycling decreased along the activity gradient from active to passive zones. Model results also revealed that anaerobic processes become more significant along the activity gradient towards passive areas.","tags":[],"title":"Capturing spatial variability of biogeochemical mass exchanges and reaction rates in wetland water and soil through model compartmentalization","type":"test_publication2"},{"authors":["Jonathan J.

Recent advancements in remotely sensed geospatial technologies are providing an increasing array of data sources (e.g., LiDAR, hyper-spectral imagery) relating to forest biophysical properties. While these data sources have the potential to improve spatial predictions of forest soil properties, considerable uncertainty exists regarding which remotely sensed (RS) indices are correlated to soil variability and what underlying pedogenic processes connect them. The main objective of this study was to identify and interpret RS indices that account for soil variability within a 2300 ha forested watershed. Redundancy analysis (RDA) and variation partitioning methods were used to uncouple the complexity of soil-environmental relationships. Thirty-two soil pedons were described, sampled, characterized and analyzed for 22 soil properties within the 0-50 cm soil depth interval. A suite of environmental covariates, comprised of LiDAR derived canopy metrics, land-surface and hydrologic terrain indices, broad-band remotely sensed indices (GeoEye-1), and narrow-band hyper-spectral indices (HyMap), were used as covariates in our RDA models. Principal coordinates of neighbor matrices (PCNM) was used to disentangle the contribution of spatial autocorrelation among sampling locations to the total variance explained by our RDA models.

Variation partitioning analysis revealed that both SPG1 and SPG2 were most strongly related to terrain and canopy indices; although spectral indices were also important, especially for SGP2. Variation in the types of RS indices correlated to each SPG results from variation in the degree to which each environmental covariate relates to the pedogenic process(es) driving soil property development. The approach used in this study can help improve our understanding of soil spatial variability through identifying the most significant environmental covariates related to soil variation.

Interception and filtration of agricultural runoff by constructed wetlands may improve water quality of return flows ultimately destined for major water bodies. This study evaluated the efficacy of two small flow-through wetlands (2.3 and 7.3 ha; hydraulic residence time = 11 and 31 h) for attenuating various forms of P from irrigation tailwaters during the 2005 irrigation season (May to September). Our goal was to examine transformations and removal efficiencies for bioavailable P in constructed wetlands. Inflow and outflow water volumes were monitored continuously and weekly water samples were collected to measure total P (TP), dissolved-reactive P (DRP), and bioavailable P (BAP). Suspended sediment was characterized and fractionated into five operationally-defined P fractions (i.e., NH4Cl, bicarbonate- dithionite, NaOH, HCl, residual) to evaluate particulate P (PP) transformations. DRP was the major source of BAP with the particulate fraction contributing from 11 to 26\\%. On a seasonal basis, wetlands removed 55 to 65\\% of PP, 61 to 63\\% of DRP, 57 to 62\\% of BAP, and 88 to 91\\% of TSS. Sequential fractionation indicated that the bioavailable fraction of PP was largely associated with clay-sized particles that remain in suspension, while less labile P forms preferentially settle with coarser sediment. Thus, removal of potentially bioavailable PP is dependent on factors that promote particle settling and allow for the removal of colloids. This study suggests that treatment of tailwaters in small, flow-through wetlands can effectively remove BAP. Wetland design and management strategies that enhance sedimentation of colloids can improve BAP retention efficiency.
