My current research examines the biogeochemical cycling of C and metals in forest ecosystem, which are largely considered aerobic environments. Growing evidence, however, suggests that forest soils may contain a high proportion of suboxic/anoxic microsites (~50% of Douglas Fir Oa horizon; Van der Lee et. al., 1999) and that ~50% of all organic matter decomposition may occur anaerobically (Schink, 2006). This may have significant implications in term of soil nutrient availability and forest productivity, dictated by how these redox microsites respond to changing forest management practices (i.e., clear-cutting, thinning, prescribed burns) and climate change. I am currently investigating how changing forest management practices and projected climate change will affect soil carbon storage and stability in forest soils.
