I am a Research Analytical Scientist with [LandPKS](https://landpotential.org/) were I work at the interface between soil/ecological sciences and big data analytics to generate science-based solutions for sustainable land management. I am a broadly-trained soil scientist with expertise in pedology, soil databases, spatial and statistical analysis, remote sensing, and applied predictive modeling. My research focuses on large-scale spatial modeling of soil and ecological resources, quantifying patterns and processes of soil and ecosystem change. I specialize in producing actionable information from big data using machine learning, deep learning, and remote sensing techniques.
