abstract = {The response hierarchy of “Avoid {\textgreater} reduce {\textgreater} reverse” is increasingly acknowledged as the best strategy for prioritizing actions designed to address land degradation at hectare to national scales. This hierarchy is based on the assumption that the economic return on investment (ROI) will usually be higher for actions that help avoid degradation than for those required to restore already degraded land. While a useful first step, the hierarchy fails to account for how differences in land potential, defined as its potential to sustainably generate ecosystem services, may affect the ROI of actions at each level of the response hierarchy. The objective of this paper is to present a strategy for improving ROI at the landscape scale and above by systematically applying a more holistic understanding of land potential to the identification and prioritization of land investments. This objective is addressed in three sections. The first section explains how the potential short- and long-term resistance and resilience of the land can be used together with its potential productivity to prioritize actions designed to avoid, reduce and reverse degradation. In the second section we explain how this prioritization can be further optimized based on an understanding of degradation risk as indicated by the land's potential to generate relatively high short-term profits under management systems that are likely to increase degradation, or result in degradation of restored land. This potential, and land managers' perception of it, depend on a wide variety of factors including markets, infrastructure, and access to technology. Together these first two sections provide a framework for increasing ROI, while reducing the risk of failure at hectare to national scales. In the final section we briefly describe the Land-Potential Knowledge System (LandPKS), a modular mobile app that makes it possible for virtually anyone with a smartphone to make the land potential determinations necessary to apply the framework described in the first two sections.},

abstract = {Ecological site descriptions (ESDs) and associated state-and-transition models (STMs) provide a nationally consistent classification and information system for defining ecological land units for management applications in the United States. Current spatial representations of ESDs, however, occur via soil mapping and are therefore confined to the spatial resolution used to map soils within a survey area. Land management decisions occur across a range of spatial scales and therefore require ecological information that spans similar scales. Digital mapping provides an approach for optimizing the spatial scale of modeling products to best serve decision makers and have the greatest impact in addressing land management concerns. Here, we present a spatial modeling framework for mapping ecological sites using machine learning algorithms, soil survey field observations, soil survey geographic databases, ecological site data, and a suite of remote sensing-based spatial covariates (e.g., hyper-temporal remote sensing, terrain attributes, climate data, land-cover, lithology). Based on the theoretical association between ecological sites and landscape biophysical properties, we hypothesized that the spatial distribution of ecological sites could be predicted using readily available geospatial data. This modeling approach was tested at two study areas within the western United States, representing 6.1 million ha on the Colorado Plateau and 7.5 million ha within the Chihuahuan Desert. Results show our approach was effective in mapping grouped ecological site classes (ESGs), with 10-fold cross-validation accuracies of 70{\%} in the Colorado Plateau based on 1405 point observations across eight expertly-defined ESG classes and 79{\%} in the Chihuahuan Desert based on 2589 point observations across nine expertly-defined ESG classes. Model accuracies were also evaluated using external-validation datasets; resulting in 56 and 44{\%} correct classification for the Colorado Plateau and Chihuahuan Desert, respectively. National coverage of the training and covariate data used in this study provides opportunities for a consistent national-scale mapping effort of ecological sites.},

abstract = {The assessment and monitoring of soil disturbance and its effect on soil
quality (i.e., ability to support a range of ecosystem services) has
been hindered due to the shortcomings of many traditional analytical
techniques, including high cost, long-term time investment and
difficulties with data interpretation. Consequently, there is a critical
need to develop rapid and repeatable approaches for quantifying changes
in soil quality that land managers may use to assess the condition and
trend of natural and managed ecosystems. Here we report on a rapid, high
throughput approach using fingerprint Fourier transformed infrared
(FTIR) spectroscopy and chemometric modeling. Fingerprint FTIR
incorporates all information embedded within the FTIR spectrum, thus
producing a biogeochemical or ecological ``fingerprint{\{}''{\}} of the soil.
This methodology was applied in a highly disturbed forest ecosystem over
a 19-year sampling period to detect, via spectral analysis, changes in
dynamic soil properties (e.g., soil organic matter and reactive
mineralogy) that can indicate changes in soil quality. Two chemometric
statistical techniques (i.e., hierarchical clustering analysis {\{}[{\}}HCA]
and discriminate analysis of principal components {\{}[{\}}DAPC]) were
evaluated for interpreting and quantifying similarities/dissimilarities
between samples utilizing the entire FTIR spectra from each sample. We
found that both statistical approaches provided a means for clearly
discriminating between degraded soils, soils in recovery, and reference
soils. DAPC analysis provided additional information on the spectral
wavenumbers most important in differentiating between soil samples
across our disturbance time series. Wavenumbers relating to stretching
of phenolic (C-O), aromatic (C=C, C-C), carboxylic acids (C=O), and to a
lesser extent aliphatic (C-H) bonds were important in discriminating
between soil samples. These results confirmed our visual interpretation
of FTIR spectra, where an increase in aliphatic (fats and lipids) and
decrease in phenolic/aromatic (lignin) absorption occurred following
intensive site disturbance, followed by a return to predisturbance
absorption values 17 years later. Results from this study illustrate the
potential of fingerprint FTIR and chemometrics as an efficient technique
for quantifying changes in soil quality that may be used in the
monitoring and assessment of soil landscape change. Additional research
across a range of soil ecosystems and under different types of ecosystem
disturbance is needed to further validate this approach and to
demonstrate its wide applicability as a land management tool.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers. A common phenomenon observed in natural and constructed wetlands is short-circuiting of flow and formation of stagnant zones that are only indirectly connected with the incoming water. Biogeochemistry of passive areas is potentially much different than that of active zones. In the research reported in this paper, the spatial resolution of a previously developed wetland nutrient cycling model was improved in order to capture the spatial variability of concentrations and reaction rates regarding nitrogen and carbon cycles throughout active and passive zones of wetlands. The upgraded model allows for several compartments in the horizontal domain, with all neighboring compartments connected through advective and dispersive/diffusive mass transport. The model was applied to data collected from a restored wetland in California that was characterized by the formation of a large stagnant zone at the southern end of the wetland due to close vicinity of the inlet and outlet structures in the northern end. Mass balance analysis revealed that over the course of the research period, about 23.4±3.9{\%} of the incoming total nitrogen load was removed or retained by the wetland. It was observed that mass of all exchanges (physical and biogeochemical) regarding nitrogen cycling decreased along the activity gradient from active to passive zones. Model results also revealed that anaerobic processes become more significant along the activity gradient towards passive areas.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the Ecological Society of America. Frequency and severity of extreme climatic events are forecast to increase in the 21st century. Predicting how managed ecosystems may respond to climatic extremes is intensified by uncertainty associated with knowing when, where, and how long effects of extreme events will be manifest in an ecosystem. In water-limited ecosystems with high inter-annual variability in rainfall, it is important to be able to distinguish responses that result from seasonal fluctuations in rainfall from long-term directional increases or decreases in precipitation. A tool that successfully distinguishes seasonal from directional biomass responses would allow land managers to make informed decisions about prioritizing mitigation strategies, allocating human resource monitoring efforts, and mobilizing resources to withstand extreme climatic events. We leveraged long-term observations (2000-2013) of quadrat-level plant biomass at multiple locations across a semiarid landscape in southern New Mexico to verify the use of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series derived from 250-m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data as a proxy for changes in aboveground productivity. This period encompassed years of sustained drought (2000-2003) and record-breaking high rainfall (2006 and 2008) followed by subsequent drought years (2011 through 2013) that resulted in a restructuring of plant community composition in some locations. Our objective was to decompose vegetation patterns derived from MODIS NDVI over this period into contributions from (1) the long-term trend, (2) seasonal cycle, and (3) unexplained variance using the Breaks for Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) model. BFAST breakpoints in NDVI trend and seasonal components were verified with field-estimated biomass at 15 sites that differed in species richness, vegetation cover, and soil properties. We found that 34 of 45 breaks in NDVI trend reflected large changes in mean biomass and 16 of 19 seasonal breaks accompanied changes in the contribution to biomass by perennial and/or annual grasses. The BFAST method using satellite imagery proved useful for detecting previously reported ground-based changes in vegetation in this arid ecosystem. We demonstrate that time series analysis of NDVI data holds potential for monitoring landscape condition in arid ecosystems at the large spatial scales needed to differentiate responses to a changing climate from responses to seasonal variability in rainfall.},

The work is made available under the Creative Commons CC0 public domain dedication. Ecological site classification has emerged as a highly effective land management framework, but its utility at a regional scale has been limited due to the spatial ambiguity of ecological site locations in the U.S. or the absence of ecological site maps in other regions of the world. In response to these shortcomings, this study evaluated the use of hyper-temporal remote sensing (i.e., hundreds of images) for high spatial resolution mapping of ecological sites. We posit that hyper-temporal remote sensing can provide novel insights into the spatial variability of ecological sites by quantifying the temporal response of land surface spectral properties. This temporal response provides a spectral 'fingerprint' of the soil-vegetation- climate relationship which is central to the concept of ecological sites. Consequently, the main objective of this study was to predict the spatial distribution of ecological sites in a semi-arid rangeland using a 28-year time series of normalized difference vegetation index from Landsat TM 5 data and modeled using support vector machine classification. Results from this study show that support vector machine classification using hyper-temporal remote sensing imagery was effective in modeling ecological site classes, with a 62{\%} correct classification. These results were compared to Gridded Soil Survey Geographic database and expert delineated maps of ecological sites which had a 51 and 89{\%} correct classification, respectively. An analysis of the effects of ecological state on ecological site misclassifications revealed that sites in degraded states (e.g., shrub-dominated/shrubland and bare/annuals) had a higher rate of misclassification due to their close spectral similarity with other ecological sites. This study identified three important factors that need to be addressed to improve future model predictions: 1) sampling designs need to fully represent the range of both within class (i.e., states) and between class (i.e., ecological sites) spectral variability through time, 2) field sampling protocols that accurately characterize key soil properties (e.g., texture, depth) need to be adopted, and 3) additional environmental covariates (e.g. terrain attributes) need to be evaluated that may help further differentiate sites with similar spectral signals. Finally, the proposed hyper-temporal remote sensing framework may provide a standardized approach to evaluate and test our ecological site concepts through examining differences in vegetation dynamics in response to climatic variability and other drivers of land-use change. Results from this study demonstrate the efficacy of the hyper-temporal remote sensing approach for high resolution mapping of ecological sites, and highlights its utility in terms of reduced cost and time investment relative to traditional manual mapping approaches.},

abstract = {Indices derived from remotely-sensed imagery are commonly used to predict soil properties with digital soil mapping (DSM) techniques. The use of images from single dates or a small number of dates is most common for DSM; however, selection of the appropriate images is complicated by temporal variability in land surface spectral properties. We argue that hyper-temporal remote sensing (RS) (i.e., hundreds of images) can provide novel insights into soil spatial variability by quantifying the temporal response of land surface spectral properties. This temporal response provides a spectral ‘fingerprint' of the soil-vegetation relationship which is directly related to a range of soil properties. To evaluate the hyper-temporal RS approach, this study first reviewed and synthesized, within the context of temporal variability, previous research that has used RS imagery for DSM. Results from this analysis support the notion that temporal variability in RS spectra, as driven by soil and climate feedbacks, is an important predictor of soil variability. To explicitly evaluate this idea and to demonstrate the utility of the hyper-temporal approach, we present a case study in a semiarid landscape of southeastern Arizona, USA. In this case study surface soil texture and coarse fragment classes were predicted using a 28 year time series of Landsat TM derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and modeled using support vector machine (SVM) classification, and results evaluated relative to more traditional RS approaches (e.g., mono-, bi-, and multi-temporal). Results from the case study show that SVM classification using hyper-temporal RS imagery was more effective in modeling both soil texture and coarse fragment classes relative to mono-, bi-, or multi-temporal RS, with classification accuracies of 67{\%} and 62{\%}, respectively. Short-term transitions between wet and dry periods (i.e., {\textless} 6 months) were the dominant drivers of vegetation spectral variability and corresponded to the general timing of significant RS scenes within in our SVM models, confirming the importance of spectral variability in predicting soil texture and coarse fragment classes. Results from the case study demonstrate the efficacy of the hyper-temporal RS approach in predicting soil properties and highlights how hyper-temporal RS can improve current methods of soil mapping efforts through its ability to characterize subtle changes in RS spectra relating to variation in soil properties.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht(outside the USA).Context: Arid rangelands have been severely degraded over the past century. Multi-temporal remote sensing techniques are ideally suited to detect significant changes in ecosystem state; however, considerable uncertainty exists regarding the effects of changing image resolution on their ability to detect ecologically meaningful change from satellite time-series. Objectives: (1) Assess the effects of image resolution in detecting landscape spatial heterogeneity. (2) Compare and evaluate the efficacy of coarse (MODIS) and moderate (Landsat) resolution satellite time-series for detecting ecosystem change. Methods: Using long-term ({\~{}}12 year) vegetation monitoring data from grassland and shrubland sites in southern New Mexico, USA, we evaluated the effects of changing image support using MODIS (250-m) and Landsat (30-m) time-series in modeling and detecting significant changes in vegetation using time-series decomposition techniques. Results: Within our study ecosystem, landscape-scale ({\textgreater}20-m) spatial heterogeneity was low, resulting in a similar ability to detect vegetation changes across both satellite sensors and levels of spatial image support. While both Landsat and MODIS imagery were effective in modeling temporal dynamics in vegetation structure and composition, MODIS was more strongly correlated to biomass due to its cleaner (i.e., fewer artifacts/data gaps) 16-day temporal signal. Conclusions: The optimization of spatial/temporal scale is critical in ensuring adequate detection of change. While the results presented in this study are likely specific to arid shrub-grassland ecosystems, the approach presented here is generally applicable. Future analysis is needed in other ecosystems to assess how scaling relationships will change under different vegetation communities that range in their degree of landscape heterogeneity.},

abstract = {Growing concern over climate and management induced changes to soil nutrient status has prompted interest in understanding the spatial distribution of forest soil properties. Recent advancements in remotely sensed geospatial technologies are providing an increasing array of data sources (e.g., LiDAR, hyper-spectral imagery) relating to forest biophysical properties. While these data sources have the potential to improve spatial predictions of forest soil properties, considerable uncertainty exists regarding which remotely sensed (RS) indices are correlated to soil variability and what underlying pedogenic processes connect them. The main objective of this study was to identify and interpret RS indices that account for soil variability within a 2300 ha forested watershed. Redundancy analysis (RDA) and variation partitioning methods were used to uncouple the complexity of soil-environmental relationships. Thirty-two soil pedons were described, sampled, characterized and analyzed for 22 soil properties within the 0-50 cm soil depth interval. A suite of environmental covariates, comprised of LiDAR derived canopy metrics, land-surface and hydrologic terrain indices, broad-band remotely sensed indices (GeoEye-1), and narrow-band hyper-spectral indices (HyMap), were used as covariates in our RDA models. Principal coordinates of neighbor matrices (PCNM) was used to disentangle the contribution of spatial autocorrelation among sampling locations to the total variance explained by our RDA models. Two groups of soil properties were identified using discriminate analysis of principal components, with each soil property group (SPG) relating to different pedogenic processes occurring with the watershed (SPG1: organic matter-metal cycling; SPG2: base-cation cycling). Our results show there was a relatively strong correspondence between soil properties and terrain/spectral indices; with 61{\%} and 81{\%} of the total variance explained by the first four RDA axes for SPG1 and SPG2, respectively. Variation partitioning analysis revealed that both SPG1 and SPG2 were most strongly related to terrain and canopy indices; although spectral indices were also important, especially for SGP2. Variation in the types of RS indices correlated to each SPG results from variation in the degree to which each environmental covariate relates to the pedogenic process(es) driving soil property development. The approach used in this study can help improve our understanding of soil spatial variability through identifying the most significant environmental covariates related to soil variation. Given the growing demands placed upon forest ecosystems (e.g., timber, recreation, carbon sequestration), improved knowledge of soil variability and the factors that affect the soil resource is essential to facilitate more effective forest management.},

A 39{\%} reduction in NO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}-N concentration was observed between wetland surface water inflows (12.87±6.43mgL{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}; mean±SD) and outflows (7.87±4.69mgL{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}).

The wetland was highly effective at removing nitrate (3866kgNO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}-N) with an estimated 75{\%} NO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}-N removal efficiency calculated from a combined water and nitrate mass balance.

abstract = {Quantifying the spatial distribution of soil properties is essential for ecological and environmental modeling at the landscape scale. Terrain attributes are among the primary covariates in soil-landscape models due to their control on energy and mass fluxes, which in turn control the spatial distribution of soil properties and processes. While numerous studies have demonstrated the importance of terrain attributes for predicting landscape-scale soil variability, considerable uncertainty exists as to the scale-dependency of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) derived terrain attributes on the accuracy of soil-landscape model predictions. Thirty five pedons were sampled by genetic horizon in a 2300ha forested watershed and three soil properties (clay, sum of bases, and total carbon), representing dominant pedogenic processes within the watershed were analyzed. Soil properties were used as dependent variables and terrain attributes, calculated from LiDAR derived DEMs of various grid resolutions (ranging from 5 to 50m) and neighborhood extents (ranging from 15 to 350m), were used as predictor variables in ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression models. Results from this study show that model predictions exhibit a strong scale-dependency, with percent clay, sum of bases, and total carbon having the highest R2-adj and lowest root mean square error (RMSE) at coarse neighborhood extents (i.e., 150 to 300m) both between soil variables and across soil depths. Furthermore, in certain instances grid resolution was also shown to affect soil-terrain correlations, although to a lesser degree than neighborhood extent. In many cases fine to moderate scale grid resolutions (i.e.,{\textless}30m) more accurately represented terrain features, resulting in higher correlations to soil properties at fixed neighborhood extents relative to course grid resolutions. Additionally, these results show that fine scale topographic information (i.e., 1 to 5m) does not necessarily provide a stronger predictor of soil spatial variability relative to moderate scale information. This study provides a robust framework for investigating pedogeomorphological processes on a landscape scale through examination of the scale dependency of modeled terrain attributes in quantitative soil-landscape modeling. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

Wetland treatment of agricultural runoff has been shown to improve water quality and promote carbon sequestration. However, the potential role of eutrophic wetlands as a source of algal loading contributing to downstream hypoxia has prompted interest in understanding algal productivity and export from these systems. This study, in the San Joaquin Valley, California, quantified a mass balance of carbon and nutrients within a seasonally-saturated constructed wetland receiving agricultural runoff, as well as quantifying autochthonous carbon production on four sampling dates during a year with minimal emergent vegetation. Results from this study show that the wetland was a net-sink for nutrients and particulate/dissolved organic carbon. Despite high concentrations of inflowing nutrients and high rates of primary productivity, high respiration rates limited net organic C production and export due to high heterotrophic activity. The addition of high C loads in inflowing water and moderate retention efficiencies, however, resulted in a positive C retention during most sampling dates. This study provides valuable insight into the connection between elevated carbon and nutrient inflows, their effects on autochthonous carbon production, and resulting carbon and nutrient outflows. {\textcopyright} Society of Wetland Scientists 2014.},

While previous studies have documented temporal variability of wetland metabolism, very little is known regarding how wetland metabolism varies spatially. This is particularly relevant for constructed flow-through wetlands used to treat agricultural runoff due to growing concern over the potential for these systems to act as incubators of biological oxygen demanding (BOD) substances (i.e., algal biomass) and contributors to downstream hypoxia. This study employed a spatially explicit characterization of wetland water column properties using multiparameter water quality sondes, thus allowing the calculation of wetland metabolism across a range of spatial scales (meters to 100s of meters). This study documented a high degree of spatial variability in metabolic rates within the wetland, with average gross primary productivity (GPP) ranging from 6.41 to 13.69gO 2m -2d -1, community respiration (CR) ranging from 4.85 to 9.79gO 2m -2d -1, and net ecosystem production (NEP) ranging from 0.35 to 2.42gO 2m -2d -1. Linkages between metabolic rates and environmental controls were quantified using a spatial/temporal statistical approach. Five key environmental parameters (turbidity, dissolved reactive phosphorus, ammonium, electrical conductivity, and temperature) were found to correlate with ecosystem metabolism. Results from this study show that despite high rates of primary productivity, high respiration rates limited NEP in this wetland due to high heterotrophic activity. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {Abstract. The fate of organic carbon (C) lost by erosion is not well understood in agricultural settings. Recent models suggest that wetlands and other small water bodies may serve as important long-term sinks of eroded C, receiving {\~{}}30 {\%} of all eroded material in the US. To better understand the role of seasonally-saturated wetlands in sequestering eroded C, we examined the spatial and temporal dynamics of C and sediment accumulation in a 13-year-old constructed wetland used to treat agricultural runoff. The fate of C sequestered within deposited sediment was modeled using point-sampling, remote sensing, and geostatistics. Using a spatially-explicit sampling design, annual net rates of sedimentation and above-ground biomass were measured during two contrasting years (vegetated (2004) vs. non-vegetated (2005)), followed by collection of sediment cores to the antecedent soil layer, representing 13 years of sediment and C accumulation. We documented high annual variation in the relative contribution of endogenous and exogenous C sources, as well as absolute rates of sediment and C deposition. This annual variation, however, was muted in the long-term (13 yr) sediment record, which showed consistent vertical patterns of uniform C distribution ({\~{}}14 g kg{\&}ndash;1) and {\&}delta;13C signatures in high depositional environments. This was in contrast to low depositional environments which had high levels of surface C enrichment (20–35 g kg{\&}ndash;1) underlain by C depleted (5–10 g kg{\&}ndash;1) sediments and an increasing {\&}delta;13C signature with depth indicating increased decomposition. These results highlight the importance of sedimentation in physically protecting soil organic carbon and its role in controlling the long-term C concentration of seasonally-saturated wetland soils. While significant enrichment of surface sediments with endogenous C occurred in newly deposited sediment (i.e., 125 kg m2 in 2004), fluctuating cycles of flooding and drying maintained the long-term C concentration at the same level as inflowing sediment (i.e., 14 g kg{\&}ndash;1), indicating no additional long-term storage of endogenous C. These results demonstrate that constructed flow-through wetlands can serve as important sinks for eroded C and sediment in agricultural landscapes, however, additional C sequestration via enrichment from endogenous sources may be limited in seasonally-saturated wetlands due to rapid decomposition during drying cycles.},

abstract = {Constructed and restored wetland soils play a key role in the cycling and retention of nutrients from polluted surface waters. Elevated SO42-loading from irrigated agriculture, however, has been shown to affect boThthe availability and mobility of P in wetland soils. This study investigated the biogeochemical cycling of Fe, S, and P in wetland pore waters and surface soils, to determine the role of sulfides in inducing mobilization of P in a constructed wetland in the Central Valley of California (CVC). Water column, pore-water, and solid-phase soil chemistry were measured at three sites, representing a range in wetland environmental conditions (i.e., sediment and nutrient loading, redox environment, and Fe-S-P geochemistry). High SO 42-concentration and active SO42-reduction in wetland pore waters contributed to elevated pore water PO43-concentration (0.42 -1.29 mg L-1) via SO 42-induced P mobilization. Although high concentrations of acid volatile sulfide (AVS) were present in the surface (0-5 cm) layer ( x : 6.5-10.3 $\mu$mol g-1), only ∼8{\%} of the labile Fe pool was S2-bound, leaving sufficient Fe to buffer S2-. Additionally, surface soils experienced a three-to four-fold increase in P sorption index (PSI) under anaerobic versus aerobic conditions. Results from solid-phase chemical extractions and chemical equilibrium modeling showed that this higher PSI may be due to the conversion of crystalline Fe(III) oxides to poorly crystalline forms, the preservation of Fe(III) oxides due to kinetic constraints on microbial Fe reduction, and the formation of Fe(II) oxides. This study demonstrates that mineral dominated wetlands withsufficient Fe to buffer boThdissolved sulfide and PO43-concentrations, can limit the effects of high SO42-loading and SO42-reduction on the mobilization and flux of soil PO43-to the wetland water column. {\textcopyright} Soil Science Society of America.},

abstract = {Nonpoint source pollution (NPSP) from agricultural runoff threatens drinking water quality, aquatic habitats, and a variety of other beneficial uses of water resources. Agricultural runoff often contains a suite of water-quality contaminants, such as nutrients, pesticides, pathogens, sediment, salts, trace metals, and substances, contributing to biological oxygen demand. Increasingly, growers who discharge agricultural runoff must comply with water-quality regulations and implement management practices to reduce NPSP. Constructed and restored wetlands are one of many best management practices that growers can employ to address this problem. This review focuses on the ability of constructed and restored wetlands to mitigate a variety of water-quality contaminants common to most agricultural landscapes. We found that constructed and restored wetlands remove or retain many water-quality contaminants in agricultural runoff if carefully designed and managed. Contaminant removal efficiency generally exceeded 50{\%} for sediment, nitrate, microbial pathogens, particulate phosphorus, hydrophobic pesticides, and selected trace elements when wetlands were placed in the correct settings. There are some potentially adverse effects of constructed and restored wetlands that must be considered, including accumulation of mercury and selenium, increased salinity, mosquito habitat, and greenhouse gas emissions. Proper wetland management and design features are discussed in order to reduce these adverse effects, while optimizing contaminant removal. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Elevated nutrient concentrations in agricultural runoff contribute to seasonal eutrophication and hypoxia in the lower portion of the San Joaquin River, California. Interception and filtration of agricultural runoff by constructed wetlands may improve water quality of return flows ultimately destined for major water bodies. This study evaluated the efficacy of two small flow-through wetlands (2.3 and 7.3 ha; hydraulic residence time = 11 and 31 h) for attenuating various forms of P from irrigation tailwaters during the 2005 irrigation season (May to September). Our goal was to examine transformations and removal efficiencies for bioavailable P in constructed wetlands. Inflow and outflow water volumes were monitored continuously and weekly water samples were collected to measure total P (TP), dissolved-reactive P (DRP), and bioavailable P (BAP). Suspended sediment was characterized and fractionated into five operationally-defined P fractions (i.e., NH4Cl, bicarbonate- dithionite, NaOH, HCl, residual) to evaluate particulate P (PP) transformations. DRP was the major source of BAP with the particulate fraction contributing from 11 to 26{\%}. On a seasonal basis, wetlands removed 55 to 65{\%} of PP, 61 to 63{\%} of DRP, 57 to 62{\%} of BAP, and 88 to 91{\%} of TSS. Sequential fractionation indicated that the bioavailable fraction of PP was largely associated with clay-sized particles that remain in suspension, while less labile P forms preferentially settle with coarser sediment. Thus, removal of potentially bioavailable PP is dependent on factors that promote particle settling and allow for the removal of colloids. This study suggests that treatment of tailwaters in small, flow-through wetlands can effectively remove BAP. Wetland design and management strategies that enhance sedimentation of colloids can improve BAP retention efficiency.

abstract = {Constructed wetlands can be important sinks of P in agricultural landscapes; however, the long-term ability of these systems to retain P often diminishes with time. This study used a spatially explicit statistical approach to characterize spatial patterns of soil properties and their correlation with P sorption in an 11-yr-old, seasonally saturated, constructed wetland receiving runoff from irrigated agriculture. The results were used to link the spatial pattern of P sorption with hydrologic, biogeochemical, and pedologic processes. A spatial sampling design was used and soil samples were measured for total P, bioavailable P, P sorption index (PSI), total C and N, texture, oxalate- and dithionite-extractable Fe and Mn, pH, electrical conductivity, water-extractable Mg, Ca, and Na, and sedimentation rate. Wetland hydrodynamics was a primary factor shaping the spatial distribution of wetland soil properties, creating three distinct hydrologic and biogeochemical zones (e.g., sediment deposition, transition, and Fe oxide transformation). Soil properties with the strongest correlation to the PSI included oxalate-extractable Fe, clay, total C, and silt. In the sediment-deposition zone, sedimentation was the dominant process influencing P sorption, contributing fresh sediments with reactive surfaces for P sorption. In contrast, the Fe oxide transformation zone received little sedimentation, resulting in greater exposure time for surface sediment alteration. Increased exposure resulted in dissolution of crystalline Fe oxides and reformation of poorly crystalline Fe oxides in a thin oxidative lens at the sediment-water column interface, thus increasing P sorption capacity. This spatially explicit investigation of P sorption in seasonally saturated wetland soils provided a robust framework within which to evaluate the wetland soil processes controlling P sorption capacity and the efficacy for long-term sorption potential. {\textcopyright} Soil Science Society of America.},

abstract = {The efficacy of using constructed wetlands (CWs) to sequester organic carbon and nutrients from irrigation tailwaters was studied in the San Joaquin Valley, California. Two CWs were monitored during the 2004 irrigation season, a new CW (W-1) and 10-year-old CW (W-2). Input/output waters from CW were collected weekly and analyzed for a variety of water quality contaminants. Organic carbon, nutrient and sediment retention efficiencies were evaluated from input/output concentrations. Characteristics of sediment were examined spatially at W-2. Results indicate that W-2 was more efficient at contaminant removal. Average particulate organic carbon retention, was 70 ± 13{\%} (mean ± standard deviation) in W-2 and 48 ± 32{\%} in W-1. Chlorophyll-a, a measure of algal biomass, was higher at W-1, especially in input waters. Initially, output concentration of chlorophyll-a increased 15-fold in W-2, however over time, as emergent vegetation established, chlorophyll-a decreased to 35{\%} of input levels. Average total N removal efficiency was 45 ± 18{\%} for W-2 compared to 22 ± 32{\%} in W-1. Total P removal efficiency was 72 ± 14{\%} at W-2 compared to 18 ± 26{\%} at W-1. CWs were most effective at removing total suspended solids, 84 ± 15{\%} and 97 ± 2{\%} for W-1 and W-2, respectively. Results demonstrate that CWs are effective at capturing POC, sediment and nutrients from irrigation tailwaters. {\textcopyright} IWA Publishing 2007.},
